to protected network resources over local and wide area networks.
Pulse Secure client also integrates with  Pulse Collaboration Suite for online
meetings. Pulse Secure client simplifies network connectivity by letting your
network administrator configure your network access environment.</p></div><p class="Para1">A <i>secure connection</i> encrypts your network
traffic so that only your endpoint and the server it is communicating
with can understand the content. Your network administrator defines
the security settings that are employed by Pulse Secure client when it establishes
a network connection. </p><p class="Para1">An <i>authenticated connection</i> means
that your endpoint and the server have both proven their identity
to each other. The server uses a certificate from a trusted certificate
authority to authenticate itself, and your endpoint presents your
login credentials to the server. Your network administrator can configure
your environment so that authentication happens automatically without
prompting you for any information, although typically you are asked
for your username and password when you connect. </p><p class="Para1">A <i>protected network resource</i> is
any network device or application that you access by means of an authenticated
connection. For example, to access your organization’s e-mail
system you first log in to your network. Pulse Secure client also enables you to
launch the Pulse Collaboration Suite client and participate in meetings.
Your network administrator organizes protected network resources in
realms and authorizes your access to those resources by granting access
to selected realms. If you have access to more than one realm, you can select
the realm you want when you connect to the network through Pulse Secure client.
The network administrator can also define the security properties
required to access a realm by enabling the Host Checker program. Host
Checker runs when you connect to the network through Pulse Secure client.
It examines your endpoint to ensure that it has required software
such as current virus  and malware protection. Your administrator can also configure
your Pulse Secure client connections to allow access to only specific network based
applications. </p><p class="Para1">Your network administrator can configure access policies
so that, after you connect to the network, your connection is portable.
For example, if you connect your laptop to your company network from
your home, you do not need to disconnect and then reconnect when you
bring your laptop into your office. You can simply close your laptop
at home. When you arrive at the office and open it up, Pulse Secure client
senses the changed network environment. Pulse Secure client uses your connection
profile information to configure your connection for appropriate access
and authenticates you in the new environment. If your administrator
has configured the location awareness feature of Pulse Secure client, then
you will be connected to the appropriate network at startup time.
For example, if your endpoint is started in a remote location, Pulse Secure client
makes a connection to a WAN access device automatically.</p><p class="Para1">Pulse Secure client enables your network administrator to “push”
new software and important software updates to your endpoint when
you connect to the network. </p><h4 class="Head4" id="jd0e208">Related Documentation</h4><ul><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-ui.html">Pulse Secure Client Interface</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer"><span class="footerleft">
