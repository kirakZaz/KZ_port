you connect to a network. Most Pulse Secure client configuration tasks are performed
by your network administrator. Your network administrator can also
enable or disable Pulse Secure client features. For example, your administrator
can configure Pulse Secure client so that it automatically connects to a particular
network or allow you to choose which connection you want.</p></div><p class="Para1">Typically, your network administrator defines the networks that
you will access. Your network administrator might also enable you
to define additional connections. If you have a laptop that you use
in the office, at home, and on the road, you most likely need one
connection for when you connect from your office and a different connection
for access when you are in a remote location. However, after you have
established one type of connection to a network, Pulse Secure client can automatically
adapt to keep you connected. For example, if you connect to your corporate
network from a remote location, and then close your laptop without
logging off and travel to your office, you can resume your computing
session without having to log in again. The portability feature, which
is called session migration, depends on how your administrator has
configured network access.</p><h4 class="Head4" id="jd0e376">Related Documentation</h4><ul><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-adding.html">Add a Connection</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-connecting.html">Connect to a Network</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer"><span class="footerleft">
