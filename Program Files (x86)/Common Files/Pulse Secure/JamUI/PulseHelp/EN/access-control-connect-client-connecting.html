you can connect to a network. The prompts you see depend on your network
access environment. </p><div style=""><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="95%" style="text-align: left;"><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="note.gif" alt=""/></td><td><p class="Para1">To use Pulse Secure client with a wireless network, you might
need to first configure your endpoint’s wireless network settings
through Windows or the wireless device software installed on your
endpoint. Or your network administrator can define your wireless connections
and scan lists, and include them in your Pulse Secure client installation. </p></td></tr></table></div><p class="Para1">If Server URL displays <strong>Selected at random</strong>, it means
that this connection was defined by the Pulse Secure client administrator. Instead
of one target server, this connection is configured with a list of
Pulse Secure client servers, and Pulse Secure client randomly selects the target server. A <strong>Change</strong> button appears in the connection details for every connection
that includes a list of servers. Click the <strong>Change</strong> button
to select the target server from the list. Your Pulse Secure client administrator
can configure the list so that Pulse Secure client always connects to the first
server in the list, to the server where you were most recently connected,
or to a server selected randomly from the list. </p><div style=""><p class="Para1">To use a defined connection to connect to a network:</p></div><ol type="1"><li id="jd0e891" style="">Click <strong>Connect</strong> for the connection you want to
establish.<p class="Para1"><strong>Or</strong></p><p class="Para1">In the system tray, right-click the Pulse Secure client icon to display the
pop-up menu, click the connection, and then click <strong>Connect</strong>.</p></li><li id="jd0e905" style="">Respond to the prompts for information such as username
and password, realm, role, and so on. The prompts you see depend on
how your network administrator has configured your access environment. <p class="Para1"/></li><li id="jd0e909" style="">A connection status dialog box appears. If the connection
attempt was successful, you can click <strong>Close</strong> or wait a moment
for the dialog box to close automatically. <p class="Para1">If there was a problem with the connection attempt, a remediation
dialog box shows information on what you can do to resolve the issue,
or a separate remediation dialog box appears and shows the progress
of measures that Pulse Secure client has started automatically to fix the
problem.</p></li></ol><p class="Para1">After you click the <strong>Connect</strong> button, you might need
to respond to the following prompts:</p><ul><li style=""><strong>Certificate</strong>—If Pulse Secure client needs to communicate
with a certificate server, and your network administrator has configured
more than one server, you are prompted to choose a server. A certificate
issued by a certificate authority verifies that the network resource
you are connecting to is valid. If the certificate is from a trusted
source, it is automatically accepted and you do not see the certificate
prompt. If there is a problem with the certificate, you might be asked
if you want to accept the certificate and proceed with the connection.</li><li style=""><strong>Realm</strong>—A <i>realm</i> defines the network resources
that you can access. If you have access to more than one realm, you
need to select one.</li><li style=""><strong>Credentials</strong>—Your username and password,
or your username and token code, establish your identity to the access
device. You might also be prompted for a secondary username and password
along with a username and password to a proxy server. Your authentication
environment might periodically prompt you to change your password
or your token PIN number. </li><li style=""><strong>Role</strong>—A <i>role</i> defines session parameters
(timeout values, the number of concurrent sessions allowed, and so
on), personalization settings, and enabled access features. Your network
administrator can allow you to choose the role you want when you connect. </li><li style=""><strong>Concurrent sessions</strong>—If you log in to
the system more than once, for example, you use the same credentials
to log in from two different computers, you might be prompted to end
the current session before beginning a new one.</li><li style=""><strong>Remediation actions</strong>—You might be prompted
to perform actions to bring your endpoint into compliance with security
policies. </li></ul><div style=""><p class="Para1">A Save Settings check box might appear on each login screen. (Your
administrator can disable this feature.) If you enable the check box,
you are not prompted for that information the next time you log in.
If you save settings, you can use the Forget Saved Settings feature
to return to being prompted for login information. Note that the Suspend
connection option is not available if you choose Forget Saved Settings
while you have an active connection. The Save Settings feature enables
you to save the following information:</p></div><ul><li style="">Certificate acceptance</li><li style="">Certificate selection</li><li style="">Realm </li><li style="">Username and password</li><li style="">Proxy username/password</li><li style="">Secondary username/password</li><li style="">Role</li></ul><p class="Para1">The steps that take place after you respond to all of the connection
prompts depend on the access polices that your network administrator
has configured and on the type of network access device. The connection
process can include the following tasks:</p><ul><li style=""><strong>Software updates</strong>—Pulse Secure client can be automatically
updated at connect time. Your system might receive updated Pulse Secure client
software or you might receive additional software modules to support
expanded services such as when you connect to a new type of network
access device for the first time.</li><li style=""><strong>Host Checker</strong>—Host Checker examines
your endpoint to determine if it meets your organization’s security
policies. For example, Host Checker might check for antivirus software
and up-to-date virus signatures, for personal firewall status, and
for the presence of malware and spyware. It can also perform tasks
such as disabling the browser AutoComplete feature and emptying your
Recycle Bin. These settings are defined by your network administrator.
If Host Checker finds a problem, it can display a message that describes
the steps you must take to fix the problem or it can initiate remediation
operations automatically.</li><li style=""><strong>Cache Cleaner</strong>—Cache Cleaner removes temporary
files stored by Internet Explorer. Cache Cleaner is run as an option
of Host Checker.</li></ul><h4 class="Head4" id="jd0e1022">Related Documentation</h4><ul><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-ui.html">Pulse Secure Client Interface</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-solve-connection-issue.html">Solve a Pulse Secure Client Connection Issue</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-forget-credentials.html">Forget Saved Settings</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer"><span class="footerleft">
