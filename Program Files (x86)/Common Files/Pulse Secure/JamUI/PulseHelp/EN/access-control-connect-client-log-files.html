If you want to save the configuration, just save the logs. Your current
Pulse Secure client configuration is saved in the log package. If you uninstall
Pulse Secure client, the program asks you if you want to save your Pulse Secure client configuration
so that when you install Pulse Secure client again, your Pulse Secure client connections and other
configuration settings are still there.</p><p class="Para1">Logging is a background operation. You do not need to make any
changes to your logging environment unless instructed to do so as
part of a troubleshooting effort. </p><p class="Para1">In addition to the Pulse Secure client log files, Pulse Secure client writes events to the Windows
application event log (Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems only).
If you have administrator access to your computer, you can use the
Windows Event Viewer to view Pulse Secure client events that have been logged to
the event log. Event log information is included when you save the
Pulse Secure client log files.</p><div style=""><p class="Para1">To help in a troubleshooting effort, you might be asked
to do the following tasks:</p></div><ul><li style=""><strong>Annotate the logs</strong>—When you annotate a
log file, you insert text that marks the log file at a specific location.
For example, to troubleshoot a connection problem, you might be asked
to annotate the log file with specific text, attempt the connection
that has been failing, and then annotate the log file again. This
sequence of events allows a support representative to search the log
file for the text you inserted. The text brackets the entries of the
log file that track your connection issue.</li><li style=""><strong>Set the log level</strong>—The default logging
level is Normal. For a troubleshooting operation, you might be asked
to change the logging level to Detailed.</li><li style=""><strong>Save the logs</strong>—The Save As operation gathers
all the log files into a single ZIP file and lets you specify where
to place the file. </li></ul><h4 class="Head4" id="jd0e736">Related Documentation</h4><ul><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-log-file-annotating.html">Annotate Log Files</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-log-preference-setting.html">Set Log Level</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-log-file-saving.html">Save Log Files</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-log-file-uploading.html">Upload Log Files</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer"><span class="footerleft">
