to use any of the following authentication methods:</p></div><ul><li style=""><p class="Para1"><strong>Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)</strong>—Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is an algorithm that uses a <strong>shared secret key</strong> and the <strong>current time</strong> to compute a password (that is, a token) that can be used only once and that expires after a short period.  The Pulse Secure desktop client and the Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) 8.2R5 gateway support Google’s TOTP authentication server (Google Authenticator).</p><div style=""><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="95%" style="text-align: left;"><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="note.gif" alt=""/></td><td><p class="Para1">Google Authenticator can be configured only as a secondary authentication server.</p></td></tr></table></div><p class="Para1">End users must register with a TOTP server before this authentication type can be used.  Generally, registration involves connecting to the TOTP authentication server (example, the PCS gateway) with a web browser, passing a primary authentication, and accessing a TOTP registration key, QR code and backup codes. After a user scans the QR code or manually enters a registration key with the Google Authenticator app on a mobile device, a 6-digit token will be generated every 30 seconds by the app for that user. These tokens can be entered in the Pulse desktop client for TOTP authentication.</p>
</li><li style=""><strong>Token authentication</strong>—RSA SecurID token
authentication, also called two-factor authentication, generates credentials
that are difficult to compromise. A token code is generated simultaneously
on both the client and server. You create a personal identification
number (PIN), and then the username and the PIN plus the current token code permit you to log
into the server. A PIN plus a token code forms a passcode. A token code expires
after a short interval and is then replaced by a newly generated token
code. The first time you use the system, Pulse Secure client prompts you to create
a PIN. If your administrator has provided a PIN, you are prompted
to change it. If your administrator requires you to change your PIN
periodically, Pulse Secure client prompts you for a new PIN. Typically, you must
provide the current token code when you change your PIN. In some cases,
after entering your passcode, you are prompted to enter the next token
code before you can access the network. Just wait until your token
device displays a new token code, and then enter that number to proceed.<p class="Para1">The device or software that generates the token is called an
authenticator. Pulse Secure client supports the full range of SecurID hardware and
software authenticators. Hardware (physical) authenticators
display a new token code every 60 seconds. You must have the card
or key fob that generates the token with you when you log in. At the
Pulse Secure client login window, you provide your username and your PIN plus the
current token code. A USB authenticator can store your Windows username/password
credentials and digital certificates. When the device is connected
to your computer, it enables automatic token code entry and Pulse Secure client
automatically accesses token codes directly off the device after you
provide your PIN.</p><p class="Para1">Software authenticators
include smartphone apps, software for desktop and laptop computers,
and browser-based applications. Your Pulse Secure client log in procedure with a
software authenticator depends on how your security administrator
has configured the system. Typically, if you have the SecurID software
installed on your endpoint, Pulse Secure client interacts with the software to retrieve
the token code after you provide your PIN. </p></li><li style=""><p class="Para1"><strong>Smart card authentication</strong>—A smart card
is a plastic card that includes embedded user authentication information.
If your environment is configured with multiple digital certificates,
Pulse Secure client prompts you to select one. Typically, if you have a smart card
reader configured on your endpoint, Pulse Secure client interacts with the smart
card software to retrieve the token code after you provide your PIN. </p></li><li style=""><strong>Machine authentication</strong>—Machine authentication
uses machine credentials to authenticate the endpoint. The credentials
are generated by Active Directory when the machine joins a domain.
The endpoint must be a member of a Windows domain. Depending on how
your administrator has configured the authentication process, you
might be prompted for your Windows credentials. </li><li style=""><p class="Para1"><strong>Credential provider</strong>—Pulse Secure client credential
provider integration enables connectivity to a network that is required
for you to log in to the Windows domain. For example, the Windows
domain controller might reside behind a firewall, and Pulse Secure client uses credential
provider login to connect to a Pulse Secure client server prior to domain login.
Pulse Secure client integrates with Microsoft credential providers to enable
password-based login and smart card login. A credential provider interface
appears as a tile on a Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 login
screen. The Pulse Secure client connection may be configured so that Pulse Secure client prompts
are presented during the login process, for example, prompts for realm
or role selection. Pulse Secure client upgrade notifications and actions are disabled
during credential provider login and postponed until the connection
is established. </p></li></ul><h4 class="Head4" id="jd0e532">Related Documentation</h4><ul><li style=""><a href="access-control-connect-client-configuration-overview.html">Pulse Secure Client Configuration Overview</a></li><li style=""><a href="access-control-delete-client-connection-status.html">Pulse Secure Client Connection Status</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer"><span class="footerleft">
